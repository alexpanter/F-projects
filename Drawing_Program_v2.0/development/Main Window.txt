The main window should contain some kind of object, which characteristics are:
	- a list(dynamic array) of all created shapes.
	    These should each have a button for:
	  	- changing the name of the shape
		- more to foreground/background (forward/back one layer)
		- manipulating the shape (rotate, scale, move, color, etc.)
		- delete the shape
		- show/hide the shape
		- lock/unlock the shape (safety against unwanted editing)


### How to best store/access information on each drawed shape? ###
Some kind of object.
Active shape (the list of shapes needs to know this, and perhaps visually enhanced in the main frame as well.)




### How to implement undo/redo options? ###
Using stack technology, multiple stacks
Each time an action is performed it is stored on the 'undo stack'.
When the user undoes an action it is stored on the 'redo stack'.
# Probably not need to worry about this until the development reaches
# a critical point.
