# FSharp-Projects
-----
F#-projects that I have made during my study time at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen.
All projects are written for Linux, and as such no guarantee is provided when running on other operating systems.

* **Crate Pusher**:  
A remake of the classis game Sokoban.

*  **Calender**:  
A terminal-driven calender app.

*  **Settlers**:  
PC version of the board game "The Settlers of Catan". (work in progress)
